### How to run a desktop on Docker ?

```
git clone https://github.com/paimpozhil/DockerX2go.git 
cd centos  ## or whatever
docker build -t [yourimagename] .
CID=$(docker run -p 2222:22 -t -d [yourimagename])

or simply 

CID=$(docker run -p 2222:22 -t -d paimpozhil/dockerx2go)
docker logs $CID

note down the root/dockerx passwords.
```

Please see README under these for more specific information

### How to run/connect to server with a Client?

Download the x2go client for your OS from:
http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient

Connect to your server with 

Host : (Your Server IP)
Port : 2222
Username : root 
Password : (varies or could be just 'changeme')

Select the Session TYPE as : XFCE or LXDE depending on your setup . 

You can also SSH to the docker container directly with root or dockerx users and their passwords over the port 2222 with linux ssh or windows putty clients.

users dockerx can be used to login however for some reason you need to use root for your very first login then you can use dockerx to login with x2go :)

```
ssh root@dockerhost -p 2222
```

### WHY ?

I wanted Isolated thin client server setup that still re-uses the disk/memory for common programs and OS.

A Full desktop running on the docker so I can painlessly create multiple isolated linux systems to which our thinclients on our offices work with.

Instead of running 20 seperate virtual machines that has the same Kernel/Same applications that take up lot of ram ( 20x) I wanted to use a common VM with same base os/applications and then users can customize the os do anything they want without killing other users/etc.

This system also works as a VERY cheap remote-desktop for anyone who wants a desktop on the cloud for anything from working remotely or browse internet where there are VPN restrictions.

Note you can run like 2-3 desktops over a cheap DigitalOcean/Linode like VPS.
